## basic knowledge
1. RNG tech. to push biology development in 21 centry:
    - **R**obot
    - **N**anotech.
    - **G**enetics
    
2. bioinformatic methods: **sequencing** & **Computing**

3. gene definition: a **message** coding with language of life

4. Answer to why **human have so few (coding) genes**: more advancing the creature is, more **non-coding gene** it has.

5. Steps of Bioinformatics: Info(biological **data**)---Model(Math and Probability **model**)---**Algorithm**(Computational)
   1. Info: medical, biological, clinical data (*Big* and *High-dimensional*). Including images & sequences

## difference between Algorithm and Model
1. In bioinformatics, **model means mathematical and probability model, while algorithm refers to computational algorithm**. 
2. When running a practice, **model is to abstract the practical issue into a series of mathematical formulus**. As to **algorithm, it's the concrete way to resolve the mathematical model** abstracted from issue.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
3. Models, like Logistic Regression specialized for classification or Random Forest for Classifier, are **mature solutions** to  a problem with certain features. Whereas algorithms such as  Dynamic Programming Algorithm used in blast, are the **foundemental method or specific path** to build and  perfect the models.![image-20230927210829157](https://github.com/Stefan-s-wang/Repo-for-Stefan-Wang/blob/main/Pictures/image-20230927210829157.png?raw=true)

## Learning Plan

- Due to my lack of prior experience in bioinformatics and computer programming languages, my learning goals are quite **foundational**.
- Aim to **master a basic use of Github, Git, Linux, and R** through a semester of learning. 
- Hope to be able to **perform relatively straightforward bioinformatics data** processing using the R, and write independent code of up to 500 lines. 
- Additionally, I intend to read and **study the book "*鸟哥的Linux私房菜-基础学习篇***".
